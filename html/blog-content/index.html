    <p>
      Our HTML Learning Area features multiple modules that teach HTML from the
      ground up — no previous knowledge required. Introduction to HTML This
      module sets the stage, getting you used to important concepts and syntax
      such as looking at applying HTML to text, how to create hyperlinks, and
      how to use HTML to structure a web page. Multimedia and embedding This
      module explores how to use HTML to include multimedia in your web pages,
      including the different ways that images can be included, and how to embed
      video, audio, and even entire other webpages. HTML tables Representing
      tabular data on a webpage in an understandable, accessible way can be a
      challenge. This module covers basic table markup, along with more complex
      features such as implementing captions and summaries. HTML forms Forms are
      a very important part of the Web — these provide much of the functionality
      you need for interacting with websites, e.g. registering and logging in,
      sending feedback, buying products, and more. This module gets you started
      with creating the client-side/front-end parts of forms. Use HTML to solve
      common problems Provides links to sections of content explaining how to
      use HTML to solve very common problems when creating a web page: dealing
      with titles, adding images or videos, emphasizing content, creating a
      basic form, etc.

    <p>CORS enabled image
        The crossorigin attribute, in combination with an appropriate CORS header, allows images defined by the <img> element to be loaded from foreign origins and used in a <canvas> element as if they were being loaded from the current origin.
        
        CORS settings attributes
        Some HTML elements that provide support for CORS, such as <img> or <video>, have a crossorigin attribute (crossOrigin property), which lets you configure the CORS requests for the element's fetched data.
        
        Preloading content with rel="preload"
        The preload value of the <link> element's rel attribute allows you to write declarative fetch requests in your HTML <head>, specifying resources that your pages will need very soon after loading, which you therefore want to start preloading early in the lifecycle of a page load, before the browser's main rendering machinery kicks in. This ensures that they are made available earlier and are less likely to block the page's first render, leading to performance improvements. This article provides a basic guide to how preload works.</p>
